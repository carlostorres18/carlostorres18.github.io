            <p>I started learning about Programming in my senior year of High School, and was eager to learn more about it, 
            so I applied for University with Computer Science as my Major, 
            so far I have faced many hardships in this journey but so far I don't have any regrets. I am going to do my very best to have fun, and learn more about Programming.</p>
