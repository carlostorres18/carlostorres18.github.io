            <h2 id="coding-journey">Carlos' Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>I started learning about Programming in my senior year of High School, and was eager to learn more about it,
            so I applied to my local University with Computer Science as my major.</p>
            <p>So far I have faced many hardships in this journey but I don't have any regrets.<br>
            I am going to do my very best to have fun, and learn more about Programming.</p>

                <summary>Update: February 26, 2026</summary>
                <p>Lately I've been getting more interested in the research side of Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning and what it takes to train agents through RL.</p>
                <p>I've also started taking initiative and attending the Machine Learning meetings my professor holds for the Machine/AI Lab at UTRGV. I've been taking advice from my professors as well as PhD and Masters students on how to get started, what to focus on, and how to build a stronger foundation for understanding ML and research as a whole.</p>
                <p>I also finally got a team for my Senior Project, which I'll be doing in my last semester of University (next semester). For our Senior Project we want to take a research approach and write and publish a paper on Reinforcement Learning and Federated Learning.</p>

                <summary>Update: November 04, 2025</summary>
                <p>WOW Almost a whole year lol (great going me from the past). I just wanted to update you all with my life update.</p>
                <p>Everything is going great, I am in my last semesters of University, I have an expected graduation date for Fall 2026, so in 1 year I will be graduating. This is both exciting and scary to think about.<br>
                    I have sign up to my next set of courses, now I will be diving head-first (lol) into AI related Courses. I have registered for Automata, AI Application Agents, and Digital Visions. I honestly can't wait to get started on them.
                    Right now I am in a SWE Class where we were tasked to build our own web-application, and I am one of the lead Developers (WOOP WOOP). So yeah, expect more from me soon in the next update.

                <summary>Update: December 16, 2024</summary>
                <p>Finals week was last week, now I am officially out of school, I ended up passing all of my classes.</p>
                <p>Right now my main focus is to prepare for my next set of classes and what type of topics the class will cover.<br>
                I will continue to also focus on working on this website and personal projects as I have already started a CSS course, and also a JavaScript course.</p>

                <summary>Update: December 05, 2024</summary>
                <p>My semester just finished yesterday (Dec 04) and the last thing i have to do is just a security project. <br><br> After that I will be working now more on this Personal Website and Personal Projects.</p>
                <p>I also added Icons to the website, so the LIFE UPDATE section has icons, and also the title page.</p>
            </details>
            <details data-tags="web,personal">
                <summary>Update: May 20, 2024</summary>
                <p>I got out of school for at least 2 weeks now, and had been on a break from coding. I decided to start working again on the website.</p>
                <p>I have realized that it is time for me to start getting serious and lock in (lol) but anyways I will add a JavaScript to the folder so that I can decorate this website to my liking.</p>
                <p>Update on application: I am still working on it, just came to a mental block on what steps to take next, but I'll be fine, I just have to devote my attention to it. Will update when something interesting happens.</p>

                <summary>Update: April 14, 2024</summary>
                <p>I started developing a desktop application using PyQt6, basically desktops development but with Python</p>
                <p>The application is a password manager, something basic so I can get started on what I want to do</p>
