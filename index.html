            <p>I started learning about Programming in my senior year of High School, and was eager to learn more about it, <br>
            so I applied to my local University with Computer Science as my Major.
            <br><br>
            So far I have faced many hardships in this journey but I don't have any regrets.<br>
            I am going to do my very best to have fun, and learn more about Programming.</p>

        <h3>LIFE/CODING UPDATES:</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>Update: December 16, 2024</summary>
            <p>Finals week was last week, now I am officially out of school, I ended up passing all of my classes.</p>
            <p>Right now my main focus is to prepare for my next set of classes and what type of topics the class will cover.<br>
            I will continue to also focus on working on this website and personal projects as I have already started a CSS course, and also a JavaScript course.</p>

            <summary>Update: December 05, 2024</summary>
            <p>My semester just finished yesterday (Dec 04) and the last thing i have to do is just a security project. <br><br> After that I will be working now more on this Personal Website and Personal Projects.</p>
            <p>I also added Icons to the website, so the LIFE UPDATE section has icons, and also the title page.</p>

            <summary>Update: May 20, 2024</summary>
            <p>I got out of school for at least 2 weeks now, and had been on a break from coding. I decided to start working again on the website.</p>
            <p>I have realized that it is time for me to start getting serious and lock in (lol) but anyways I will add a JavaScript to the folder so that I can decorate this website to my liking.</p>
            <p>Update on application: I am still working on it, just came to a mental block on what steps to take next, but I'll be fine, I just have to devote my attention to it. Will update when something interesting happens.</p>

            <summary>Update: April 14, 2024</summary>
            <p>I started developing a desktop application using PyQt6, basically desktops development but with Python</p>
            <p>The application is a password manager, something basic so I can get started on what I want to do</p>
