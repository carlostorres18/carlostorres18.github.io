            <summary>👨‍💻Carlos' Coding Journey</summary>
            <p>I started learning about Programming in my senior year of High School, and was eager to learn more about it, 
            so I applied for University with Computer Science as my Major, 
            so far I have faced many hardships in this journey but so far I don't have any regrets. I am going to do my very best to have fun, and learn more about Programming.</p>

            <summary>Update: April 14, 2024</summary>
            <p>I started developing a desktop application using PyQt6, basically desktops development but with Python</p>
            <p>The application is a password manager, something basic so I can get started on what I want to do</p>

            <summary>Update: May 20, 2024</summary>
            <p>I got out of school for at least 2 weeks now, and had been on a break from coding. I decided to start working again on the website, because</p>
            <p>I have realized that it is time for me to start getting serious and lock in (lol) but anyways I will add a JavaScript to the folder so that I can decorate this website to my liking.</p>
            <p>Update on application: I am still working on it, just came to a mental block on what steps to take next, but I'll be fine, I just have to devote my attention to it. Will update when something interesting happens.</p>
